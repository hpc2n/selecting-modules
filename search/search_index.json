This is done much the same as when you just load them on the command line. Note Any longer, parallel, heavy jobs should be run as a batch job in order not to overload the login node and make it slow/unusuable for everyone. When you write a batch script you have to load the modules you need to run the job , just as you would have otherwise. If the module has prerequisites, they have to be loaded before the module The modules you load need to be compatible with each other, just like when you load them on the command line. When you load modules inside a batch script, there are only really three different cases: serial jobs parallel/MPI jobs GPU jobs We will use Python and various Python package modules as an example. Note A batch job is submitted to the batch queue with sbatch <batchjob.sh> . Serial jobs \u00b6 Here you do not need MPI-enabled modules. If the module has both a GPU and a CPU version, you should load the CPU version. Example - serial job script The example Python script used here is mmmult.py .

This is done much the same as when you just load them on the command line. Note Any longer, parallel, heavy jobs should be run as a batch job in order not to overload the login node and make it slow/unusuable for everyone. When you write a batch script you have to load the modules you need to run the job , just as you would have otherwise. If the module has prerequisites, they have to be loaded before the module The modules you load need to be compatible with each other, just like when you load them on the command line. When you load modules inside a batch script, there are only really three different cases: serial jobs parallel/MPI jobs GPU jobs We will use Python and various Python package modules as an example.

You can do this at Bianca (UPPMAX), but load the uppmax module afterwards. List the loaded modules Get some information about a module ( module show and module help ) Learn about module collections to load/unload a bunch of modules ( module save <collection> and module restore <collection> ) In the previous section we saw how to find out which modules are available at a centre, including looking for a specific software module. Now it is time to learn more useful module commands! Finding software versions \u00b6 If you just load a module without specifying the version, you will (depending on centre) get the default version or an error. There are good reasons not to just load the default version, even when it is possible: The default version is often the newest one installed, which means the default changes the next time an even newer version is installed. This could break your code or at least give a different result, which is bad for resproducibility. Sometimes you actually need a specific version, which could differ from the one the centre has decided on as default. So how do you find out which versions are available for a specific software? Note This is done differently, depending on the center you are at: HPC2N, LUNARC, C3SE, PDC: module spider MODULE or ml spider MODULE UPPMAX, NSC, /C3SE): module avail MODULE or ml avail MODULE With module spider \u00b6 Recommended at HPC2N, LUNARC, C3SE, and PDC. Note The command to find the available versions for a software module named MODULE is: module spider MODULE or, in short form ml spider MODULE With module avail \u00b6 Recommended at UPPMAX and NSC. Note The command to find the available version for a software module named MODULE is: module avail MODULE or, in short form ml av MODULE Example \u00b6 Finding available versions of Python.

List loaded modules \u00b6 There is a very useful command to list which modules you have loaded. It is module list or, in short form ml Tip Try it now! With nothing loaded, only the \u201csticky\u201d modules are listed. They are modules that are needed for the environment to function correctly, so do not remove them! Load software module \u00b6 In order to load modules, we need to know how . This differs by center only inasmuch as some centers have prerequisites (usually compiler toolchains ) for most of the software modules. The centers that recommend module spider for finding the software modules generally have prerequisites (HPC2N, LUNARC, PDC - and sometimes C3SE), while those who recommend module avail generally do not (UPPMAX, NSC). Thus; if the centers suggests you do module spider you will need to check the required prerequisites to load. Prerequisites \u00b6 This is done with module spider <module>/<version> You can also do this at the centers recommending module avail , but that will generally just tell you the module can be loaded directly. Prerequisites At some centres it is common that modules have prerequisites (usually GCC, various libraries or something similar) while at other centres most modules can be loaded directly. HPC2N : most software modules have prerequisites (GCC/Intel, OpenMPI, \u2026), a few do not (MATLAB, \u2026) LUNARC : most software modules have prerequisites (GCC/Intel, OpenMPI, \u2026), a few do not (MATLAB, \u2026) UPPMAX : software modules can generally be loaded directly unless its is related to bioinformatics (then load bioinfo-tools first). New cluster Pelle does not require you to load bioinfo-tools Note On Pelle things are more like NSC, you may follow the examples for that cluster instead of Bianca Though, note that output details will most probably be different on Pelle! NSC : software modules can generally be loaded directly PDC : most software modules have prerequisites (PDC which is a collection of compilers and libraries), a few do not (MATLAB, cray-modules, \u2026) C3SE : software modules can generally be loaded directly HPC2N UPPMAX NSC PDC Example, finding out how to load Python, version 3.12.3 b-an01 [ ~ ] $ module spider Python/3.12.3 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Python: Python/3.12.3 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Description: Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.

The numpy and scipy modules are configured to call Cray Libsci routines. The mpi4py module is configured to call Cray MPICH routines. Cray Python is designed to run Python codes on the compute nodes of an HPE supercomputer. HPE does not make changes to the Python source or any of its libraries nor does it plan to make changes in future releases. The cray-python 3 .11.7 release contains - python-3.11.7 - numpy-1.24.4 - scipy-1.10.1 - mpi4py-3.1.4 - dask-2023.6.1 Product and OS Dependencies --------------------------- The cray-python 3 .11.7 release is supported on - Cray EX systems running SLES 15 or RHEL 8 Documentation ------------- https://www.python.org/doc Changelog --------- https://docs.python.org/release/3.11.7/whatsnew/changelog.html Modulefile ---------- module load cray-python/3.11.7 Installation ------------ rpm -ihv cray-python-3.11.7-20240617153007.0687944-1.sles15sp4.x86_64.rpm To make this the default version, execute /opt/cray/pe/admin-pe/set_default_files/set_default_python_3.11.7 Certain components, files, or programs contained within this package are \u00a9 Copyright 2021 -2024 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP =================================================================== To re-display python/3.11.7 release information, type: less /opt/cray/pe/python/3.11.7/release_info =================================================================== We learn: Generally use cray-python instead of python You can load it with no prerequisites (there are normally prerequisites on Dardel (PDC)) Loading \u00b6 To load a software module, do: (if needed) module load <prerequisite>/<suitable version> module load <module>/<compatible version> and the versions you got from module spider .

Or you can do them one at a time, as you want. The modules have to be loaded in order! You cannot list the prerequisite after the module that needs it! One advantage to loading modules one at a time is that you can then find compatible modules that depend on that version easily. Example: you have loaded GCC/13.2.0 and Python/3.11.5 at HPC2N or LUNARC. You can now do ml av or module avail to see which versions of other modules you want to load, say SciPy-bundle , are compatible. If you know the name of the module you want, you can even start writing module load SciPy-bundle/ (for instance) and press TAB - the system will then autocomplete to the compatible one(s). Loading several modules \u00b6 There are situations where you need to load several modules, even at centres where there are no prerequisites. Example You need some Python packages not included in the base Python you loaded, for instance PyTorch, or TensorFlow, or maybe AlphaFold. You now need to load a version of that module which is compatible with the Python you want. HPC2N UPPMAX NSC PDC Tensorflow needs Python and SciPy-bundle. SciPy-bundle also needs OpenMPI.

Note Why would you want to unload a module? If you want to use a different version of a module, you need to unload the current one first If you need a different version of a dependent module, but it is not compatible with the current prerequisite you have loaded Modules can be unloaded with: module unload <MODULE> may or may not work module unload <MODULE>/<version> ml unload <MODULE>/<version> short form of the above module -<MODULE>/<version> ml -<MODULE>/<version> short form of the above ml -<MODULE>/<version> short form of the above Unloading a module will not unload the prerequisites . This is not usually a problem at the centres where there rarely are prerequisites (UPPMAX, NSC), but can be annoying at centres who usually have prerequisites for the modules (HPC2N, LUNARC, C3SE, PDC). However, there the easy solution is module purge (HPC2N, LUNARC, C3SE). The command module purge removes all the loaded modules, except the \u201csticky\u201d modules. It is recommended at HPC2N, LUNARC, and C3SE. Warning Do not use module purge at PDC! At PDC, there are a lot of necessary, \u201csystem-modules\u201d that are preloaded. When you do module purge they will also be unloaded and things may not work as it should! At UPPMAX (Bianca, not Pelle), the system-module \u201cuppmax\u201d will get unloaded with module purge , but can easily be reloaded with module load uppmax . To see what the uppmax module does, do: ml show uppmax . It sets some environment variables and aliases.

CUDA gives developers access to the virtual instruction set and memory of the parallel computational elements in CUDA GPUs. More information ================ - Homepage: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit module save/restore \u00b6 Module collections are used to load/unload a bunch of modules: module save <collection> and module restore <collection> . This can be useful if you often need to load the same several modules in specific versions, for instance. Creating a module collection \u00b6 Load the modules you need. Save the collection (you can name it as you want, here MYMODULES): module save MYMODULES Example Assuming we need pandas and matplotlib at HPC2N (very similar to LUNARC): Load the modules b-an01 [ ~ ] $ module load GCC/12.3.0 b-an01 [ ~ ] $ module load Python/3.11.3 b-an01 [ ~ ] $ module load OpenMPI/4.1.5 b-an01 [ ~ ] $ module load SciPy-bundle/2023.07 b-an01 [ ~ ] $ module load matplotlib/3.7.2 Save to a collection (here, \u201cmypython\u201d) b-an01 [ ~ ] $ module save mypython Saved current collection of modules to: \"mypython\" b-an01 [ ~ ] $ Then, maybe later you find you also need mpi4py so you load it and add it to the collection: b-an01 [ ~ ] $ ml mpi4py/3.1.4 b-an01 [ ~ ] $ module save mypython Saved current collection of modules to: \"mypython\" b-an01 [ ~ ] $ After you have been logged out and in again, or maybe unloaded/purged the modules, you can then restore it again: b-an01 [ ~ ] $ module restore mypython Restoring modules from user ' s mypython b-an01 [ ~ ] $ You can get a listing of all your module collections by typing: b-an01 [ ~ ] $ module savelist To query the contents of a module collection use b-an01 [ ~ ] $ module describe mypython Warning If you are working on PDC\u2019s cluster Dardel, and are used to the command module purge then this is a good way of restoring the system-modules: Immediately after logging in (before loading or unloading anything) create a collection: module save pdcsystem (name as you want) Then, after you have done module purge , just do module restore pdcsystem and you are back to the correct system setup. Workflow - module collections \u00b6 Create a module collection Work with it Possibly unload all modules and load different ones to work with Then later restore the module collection again and keep working Possibly add more modules and save them to the collection Each time you have logged out and are logging in again, you can easily restore the modules you need Much safer than having it in your .bashrc since that is something easily forgotten about and then when you suddenly need to work with different modules or different versions, maybe months later, you are wondering why it is not working as it should and the reason is that you have auto-loaded things in your .bashrc ! Exercise Try loading some modules create a module collection do module list to see what you have unload the modules check with module list restore the module collection check with module list Hints \u00b6 Note How would you find, for instance, installed Python package modules for a specific Python version? Important At centres with prerequisites, you need to load, say, GCC instead of GCCcore in order to be able to access, for instance, SciPy-bundle!!! You also need to load a compatible OpenMPI in order to be sure to get all available installed Python package modules. Example, HPC2N (Very similar to LUNARC) First load the Python module and prerequisites, and OpenMPI b-an01 [ ~ ] $ module load GCC/12.3.0 b-an01 [ ~ ] $ module load Python/3.11.3 b-an01 [ ~ ] $ module load OpenMPI/4.1.5 Then you can check what Python package modules are installed (scroll down a bit): b-an01 [ ~ ] $ module avail ... ----------------------- This is a list of module extensions \"module --nx avail ...\" to not show. ------------------------ ( E ) fontBitstreamVera ( E ) ADGofTest ( E ) fontLiberation ( E ) AICcmodavg ( E ) fontawesome ( E ) ALDEx2 ( E ) fontquiver ( E ) ALL ( E ) fonttools ( E ) AMAPVox ( E ) forcats ( E ) ANCOMBC ( E ) foreach ( E ) ATACseqQC ( E ) forecast ( E ) AUC ( E ) foreign ( E ) AUCell ( E ) formatR ( E ) Aerial-Gym-Simulator ( E ) formula.tools ( E ) AgiMicroRna ( E ) formulaic ( E ) AlgDesign ( E ) fossil ( E ) Algorithm::Dependency ( E ) fpc ( E ) Algorithm::Diff ( E ) fpp ( E ) Alien::Base ( E ) fracdiff ( E ) Alien::Build::Plugin::Download::GitLab ( E ) fresh ( E ) Alien::Libxml2 ( E ) frozenlist ( E ) AlphaFold ( E ) fs ( E ) AlphaPulldown ( E ) fsc.export ( E ) ... The \u201cmodule extensions\u201d are things that are available as part of a modules. Sometimes several for each module. You can see for instance \u201cforeach\u201d R package is available (the list has everything available, not just Python packages). You can then do module spider foreach to see versions and then module spider foreach/1.5.2 to see where you find that extension. If you keep going further down on the list you got with \u201cmodule avail\u201d then you see that \u201cmpi4py\u201d is available and that \u201cpandas\u201d is available. Let us see how to load these. Doing b-an01 [ ~ ] $ module avail mpi4py tells us it can be loaded directly Doing b-an01 [ ~ ] $ module avail pandas gives some conflicting answer, so we try with module spider pandas and then module spider pandas/version to learn that it is part of SciPy-bundle. We can then load SciPy-bundle directly and get \u201cpandas\u201d available. Note Of course, you can always try doing module spider <software or package> and module avail <software or package> directly to see if you are lucky and get the name it is called.

This could break your code or at least give a different result, which is bad for resproducibility. Sometimes you actually need a specific version, which could differ from the one the centre has decided on as default. So how do you find out which versions are available for a specific software?

One advantage to loading modules one at a time is that you can then find compatible modules that depend on that version easily. Example: you have loaded GCC/13.2.0 and Python/3.11.5 at HPC2N or LUNARC. You can now do ml av or module avail to see which versions of other modules you want to load, say SciPy-bundle , are compatible. If you know the name of the module you want, you can even start writing module load SciPy-bundle/ (for instance) and press TAB - the system will then autocomplete to the compatible one(s).","title":"Loading"},{"location":"commands/#loading__several__modules","text":"There are situations where you need to load several modules, even at centres where there are no prerequisites.

You can then do module spider foreach to see versions and then module spider foreach/1.5.2 to see where you find that extension. If you keep going further down on the list you got with \u201cmodule avail\u201d then you see that \u201cmpi4py\u201d is available and that \u201cpandas\u201d is available.

Thus, knowing about modules is necessary for you to be able to access the majority of the installed software at a centre! Modules are: used to set up your environment (paths to executables, libraries, etc.) for using a particular (set of) software package(s) a tool to help users manage their Unix/Linux shell environment, allowing groups of related environment-variable settings to be made or removed dynamically allows having multiple versions of a program or package available by just loading the proper module are installed in a hierarchial layout. This means that some modules are only available after loading a specific compiler and/or MPI version, etc. that is, the modules have prerequisites that needs to be loaded before they can be loaded. Whether or not modules have prerequisites vary by center. More on this later! Many of the centres in Sweden are using the Lmod module system. It is an environment module system that is Lua based. Many, but not all, of the centres in Sweden are using the EasyBuild framework for building and installing software modules. PDC also provides some software as containers, found in /pdc/software/sing_hub (or $PDC_SHUB ). singularity exec -B /cfs/klemming <sandbox folder> <myexe> LUMI has no modules and uses containers Important Take care not to use any system-installed versions of gcc , python , etc. Always use the module instead, when available! Always check if there is a module instead of just building the software/package yourself! Remember to check with different capitalization! If the center you are at have modules installed in a hierarchical fashion (LUNARC, HPC2N, PDC) you must use module spider to check if a software is installed, since module avail only lists what is available with what is currently loaded If there is a software missing that you need, then ask if it can be installed. Useful commands \u00b6 This is a list of some of the most useful commands for the module system. In the list below, MODULE is used as a stand-in for any software module. See which modules exists: module spider or ml spider See which versions exist of a specific module: module spider MODULE or ml spider MODULE This way is only recommended at HPC2N, LUNARC, (C3SE), and PDC See prerequisites and how to load a specfic version of a module: module spider MODULE/VERSION or ml spider MODULE/VERSION List modules depending only on what is currently loaded: module avail or ml av At UPPMAX and NSC (and C3SE) this will list all available modules! On Bianca, bioinfo tools are seen after loading bioinfo-tools See which modules are currently loaded: module list or ml Loading a module: module load MODULE or ml MODULE Loading a specific version of a module: module load MODULE/VERSION or ml MODULE/VERSION Unload a module: module unload MODULE or ml -MODULE Get more information about the paths etc. of a module: ml show MODULE or module show MODULE Get information about what is in a module: module help MODULE or ml help MODULE Unload all modules except the \u2018sticky\u2019 modules: module purge or ml purge Module collections to load/unload a bunch of modules: module save <collection> and module restore <collection> Finding existing modules \u00b6 Warning This differs somewhat between centres. Some centres recommend using module avail while at others it is better to use module spider ! This is mainly to do with whether or not modules in general have prerequisite modules that needs loading before, or not. module spider : HPC2N, LUNARC, (C3SE), PDC module avail : UPPMAX, NSC, C3SE With module spider \u00b6 This is the recommended way to find existing software modules at HPC2N , LUNARC , ( C3SE ), and PDC .

Exercise Try listing the available modules. Use either module spider or module avail , depending on your centre.

In this chapter we will look at some examples of how to find and load some of the typical software modules that are installed at many of the Swedish HPC centres. Loading modules works the same whether the modules are toolchains or standalone packages, with and without prerequisites. The procedure is usually some variation on the following: Use ml spider <package> to see whether a module is installed , and if so, view the available versions. (At facilities that do not hide packages depending on prerequisites, module avail <package> may be preferred.) Use ml spider <package>/<version> to view prerequisites for a specific version of the module, if any. Load the modules with ml <prerequisite>/<version> <package>/<version> . Most of the examples below use outputs from Cosmos, but the workflows will be similar at other institutions except where otherwise noted. Outline \u00b6 Principles of making Python and R packages available to scripts and interactive analysis. Start popular tools like MATLAB and OpenFOAM and notes about licensed software Exercise : Dig deeper into your favorite tools Packages \u00b6 Important Both R and Python packages often include many so-called extensions (dependent packages that are usually called modules when not dealing with LMOD modules) that are installed, but cannot be found with ml spider or ml avail . In these cases, if you have loaded at least the prerequisites of a standalone package containing the extension, you can use ml show <package> on the standalone package to view the Lua module file, which usually has a section on included extensions near the top. For example, NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas, among other packages, are all are included in SciPy-bundle . If you have at least loaded a GCC version, you can use ml show SciPy-bundle to view all of the included extensions (Python modules) in the compatible SciPy-bundle. Python-based packages \u00b6 We already learned how to load Python module of a specific version. It varies between clusters how many packages are installed with the base Python packages, how many are installed as separate modules, what prerequisites are required (most centres apart from PDC are the same), and the available version numbers. Packages at the clusters HPC2N and C3SE: Little is installed with the Python module, but most of the common Python packages are available as extra modules (SciPy-bundle, Jupyter, mpi4py, matplotlib, tensorflow, PyTorch, Python-bundle-PyPi, \u2026) LUNARC: Little is installed with the Python module, but instead most of the common Python packages are available as extra modules (SciPy-bundle, Jupyter, mpi4py, matplotlib, tensorflow, PyTorch, Python-bundle-PyPi, \u2026). Anaconda3 bundles more into one module (SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc), but other modules loaded alongside it are typically not recognised. Additional modules must be installed in a custom environment. NSC: Little is installed with the Python module, but most of the common Python packages are available as extra modules (SciPy-bundle, matplotlib, mpi4py, PyTorch, Python-bundle-PyPi, Jupyter, \u2026). Most programs on Tetralith also have an extra prerequisite, buildtool-easybuild/4.X.X-hpc<version> that must be loaded before anything else. UPPMAX-Pelle: Little is installed with the Python module, but most of the common Python packages are available as extra modules (SciPy-bundle, matplotlib, mpi4py, Python-bundle-PyPi, Jupyter-lab, \u2026). No Prerequisites are needed! UPPMAX-Bianca: Very many packages are installed with the Python module. PDC: most modules included in SciPy-bundle (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, etc.) are in cray-python modules, and these are compatible with a couple of the installed versions of matplotlib. Python modules that do not include the cray- prefix have very little installed in them and are not compatible with most other Python-adjacent modules; these are typically intended as bases for users to build their own environments. Most programs on Dardel also have an extra prerequisite, PDC/XX.XX or PDCOLD/XX.XX that must be loaded before anything else. Bundles \u00b6 The bundle names reflect the content, like Python packages, and its version, but also which Python version, compilers and libraries that are compatible with it. The module endings may contain GCCcore-X.Y.Z and/or [YEAR-a/b]. Example SciPy-bundle/2024.05-gfbf-2024a or Python/3.12.3-GCCcore-13.3.0 GCCcore reflects the GCC compiler version that is compatible when using C/C++ \u201cback end\u201d code. The year reflects an EasyBuild toolchain, see FOSS toolchains . Some FOSS tool chains and Python version using them FOSS Python version GCC version Bundle version 2024a 3.12.3 13.3.0 2024.06/06 2025b 3.13.5 14.3.0 2025.07 foss is the full level toolchain. gfbf means that the libraries FlexiBLAS (incl. LAPACK) + FFTW are included. gompi means that the MPI library OpenMPI is included. See Toolchain diagram Warning Make sure to use bundles that are compatible with each-other and with needed Python version. Otherwise it is better to create isolated environments with Conda or virtual environments, see Virtual environments in Python . Some well-known bundles HPC and big data dask mpi4py numba Scientific tools SciPy-bundles: numpy , pandas , scipy xarray Biopython Interactivity iPython JupyterLab Graphics and diagrams Matplotlib Seaborn Machine Learning scikit-learn PyTorch TensorFlow Bundle of useful packages Python-bundle-PyPI See also about Python bundles at Pelle Principles \u00b6 Decide what you need! Start new project with newest toolchain Go for version you have used before (reproduce) Exact versions of many packages may need an isolated environment. Load one or several bundles, python is loaded on the fly! Check versions ml spider matplotlib This is a very good way to find packages that are not in a bundle with the same name. For instance, pandas and numpy are parts of the SciPy-bundle or ml avail matplotlib Load prerequisites, if needed, and then ml matplotlib/<version> or ml matplotlib/<version> Start Python session in a console with python Load a needed library, like import matplotlib Isolated environments The course Python in an HPC environment: isolated environments Using Bianca? There are no bundle modules on Bianca But, the Python modules have very many packages installed already. Tip grep does not work directly on the outputs of module commands like ml show <module> . To search for an extension in a very long Lua module file, copy the full path of the .lua file from the ml show output, and use less /path/to/module.lua | grep <extension> . If there is no output, the extension is not present. Missing a package? Install by conda, pip or other tool or contact support Install packages Use isolated environments Python IDEs \u00b6 If you are comfortable editing code in a basic text editor and running at the command-line, the modules used in the example above are all you need. For more information on choosing and loading IDEs to work with Matplotlib graphics interactively, we refer readers to this documentation from the Python for HPC course . Python IDEs Jupyter Spyder Visual Studio Code HPC-python course Starting from command line Starting from OnDemand R \u00b6 Important Most facilities have only built a handful of R releases, so many of the dependent modules are adapted for multiple versions. The version of such any dependent package should always be specified to ensure reproducibility. If the version number is omitted, the latest will be loaded by default, and that version may change without warning. Most HPC centres have prerequisites for R, but at a few, like Alvis, R can be loaded directly. Always check the prerequisites with ml spider or ml avail . Principles \u00b6 Check versions Load prerequisites if needed and then R Start R console with R R-based packages \u00b6 At most HPC centres, the base R module usually contains relatively few extensions. Most of the popular packages are in additional bundles like the general R-bundle-CRAN and bundle for genomic tools R-bundle-Bioconductor . Most HPC centres have prerequisites for R, but at a few, like Alvis, R can be loaded directly. Always check the prerequisites with ml spider or ml avail . Cluster-specific approaches NSC (Tetralith): R can be loaded directly, but contains few installed packages, and there are no bundles to provide more. Users are typically expected to install their own extension libraries. RStudio is included in the base R module, however . PDC (Dardel): Like most programs on Dardel, R also has the prerequisite PDC/XX.XX or PDCOLD/XX.XX , but the compiler and MPI library are chosen for you. There are about 250 packages available in the basic R module, and there are no additional bundles to provide more packages. Users are typically expected to install their own extension libraries. C3SE (Alvis): R can be loaded directly, but has few installed packages. RStudio can only be reached from an OnDemand session. UPPMAX (Bianca) : R can be loaded directly, but has few installed packages. More common modules are available as extensions with the R_packages module. RStudio is also a separate module. LUNARC: Little is installed with the basic R module, but most common packages are available as extensions of R-bundle-CRAN or R-bundle-Bioconductor. RStudio is also a separate module, and is available as an On-Demand application that automatically loads R and various bundles at start-up. UPPMAX (Pelle): Little is installed with the basic R module, but most common packages are available as extensions of R-bundle-CRAN or R-bundle-Bioconductor. RStudio is also a separate module. HPC2N: Little is installed with the basic R module, but most common packages are available as extensions of R-bundle-CRAN, R-bundle-CRAN-extra, or R-bundle-Bioconductor. RStudio is a separate module and only runs on the login nodes via Thinlinc, so it should be used sparingly. About packages on HPC systems Course module on R packages Many R-packages conveniently specify the version of R they are compatible with in the module name. One example of this is Bioconductor. Principles \u00b6 Check versions ml spider R-bundle or ml avail R-bundle Load prerequisites, if needed, and then ml R-bundle-CRAN/<version> or ml R-bundle-Bioconductor/<version> The bundles should start the R interpreter ion the fly. Start R session in a console with R Load a needed library, like > library ( parallel ) Missing a package? Install by yourself or contact support Course material RStudio \u00b6 Many clusters have RStudio as a module but for Alvis and Dardel RStudio can only be reached from OnDemand. RStudio from course RStudio Popular tools \u00b6 There are of course many popular tools among cluster users. Many of them can be found in every cluster, but some clusters are more niched and may lack some of these common tools. Capitalisation and other naming conventions may vary between HPC centres. Note Are you lacking a tool? Ask the support to install it! Principle \u00b6 Check versions with spider or avail Load prerequisites, if needed, and then ml <module name> Start the tool by following documentation of the tool or the local cluster documentation. Usually it is the tool name with lower case or with the first letter capitalised. Or, like for OpenFOAM, commands starting with foam . You may try out one or several tools in Exercise 3. There we also give a bit more detailed info about MATLAB OpenFOAM MATLAB in HPC course Intro to MATLAB ??? note \u201cMATLAB Add-Ons and Toolboxes These should be available through the Matlab GUI. Important The Matlab GUI and many other graphical tools is prone to hogging resources if not launched carefully, which makes it risky to run on a login node. In general, the GUI should only be run via either Desktop On Demand or after booking interactive allocations on compute nodes with salloc or interactive . For more particulars on running Matlab, see the relevant page of the R, Matlab, and Julia for HPC course materials . Specialised Applications \u00b6 For most specialised packages (Amber, GROMACS, Nextflow, VASP, etc), (unless there is reason to believe it is included in a larger package or you include a spurious non-alphanumeric character), ml spider will tell you whether it is installed or not. If the full name of a module includes CUDA , then the relevant CUDA version will typically be loaded automatically, without the need to choose a CUDA-containing toolchain. Licenses Some specialised modules (e.g., Abaqus, Gaussian, and VASP) are license-restricted, so they may not load, or may load but refuse to run, if you are not part of the licensed user group. If you run ml spider on a specific version of licensed software, the description may (as with VASP) or may not (as with Gaussian) specify that a license is required. It is up to users to determine the licensing requirements of specialised software packages. Exercises (Stop recording) \u00b6 Choose 1 or possibly 2 Python bundles R bundles (Tip, do not choose if using Tetralith, Alvis or Dardel) Matlab and other favorite tool (Tip, try several, if you don\u2019t find one on your cluster) Let us know if you miss something. Break-out rooms according to interest and/or cluster Python \u00b6 These clusters do NOT have Python bundles Dardel Tetralith Alvis Exercise 1: Find python documentation of your cluster Cluster documentation of Python UPPMAX HPC2N LUNARC NSC PDC C3SE Exercise 2: Find if there is a matplotlib package in a module Tip ml spider is good here. Matplotlib across centres Matplotlib prerequisites vary significantly across HPC centres: some require none, some need one, some need more than one, and in some cases Matplotlib is only an extension of another module ( more info on how to find Matplotlib at different HPC centres here ). If you only want to see what Matplotlib depends on, a good starting point is to view the output of ml spider matplotlib (or ml avail matplotlib on NSC), pick an arbitrary version, and view ml spider matplotlib/<version> . Exercise 3: Make the Python package Matplotlib available to you and test to load it in a python shell Tip ml <module name> is good here. Example workflow All of the following code blocks in this example are taken from Cosmos. $ ml spider matplotlib ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- matplotlib: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Description: matplotlib is a python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. matplotlib can be used in python scripts, the python and ipython shell, web application servers, and six graphical user interface toolkits. Versions: matplotlib/2.2.5-Python-2.7.18 matplotlib/3.3.3 matplotlib/3.4.2 matplotlib/3.4.3 matplotlib/3.5.2 matplotlib/3.7.0 matplotlib/3.7.2 matplotlib/3.8.2 matplotlib/3.9.2 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- If you try the above command at your local HPC centre and get a \u201cnot found\u201d error, that probably means Matplotlib is an extension of another module (e.g. on Bianca, there are versions that are part of the base Python module and versions that are part of python_ML_packages ). Let us look at matplotlib/3.8.2 , for example: $ ml spider matplotlib/3.8.2 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- matplotlib: matplotlib/3.8.2 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Description: matplotlib is a python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. matplotlib can be used in python scripts, the python and ipython shell, web application servers, and six graphical user interface toolkits. You will need to load all module ( s ) on any one of the lines below before the \"mat plotlib/3.8.2\" module is available to load. GCC/13.2.0 This means that, on Cosmos at least, only GCC must be loaded before Matplotlib. However, Matplotlib is barely usable without the tools to read in or create the data arrays, so NumPy and/or Pandas are also needed. At most facilities, that means SciPy-bundle is required. Note that ml show matplotlib/<version> does not show which Python version is associated with that version of Matplotlib. If GCC is loaded, then you can use ml avail with Python , matplotlib , and/or SciPy-bundle to see which versions of these are available to load. The more typical scenario is that you want to move code developed on a personal laptop to the cluster. Then you will mainly be constrained to a range of Python versions Python/X.Y.Z , in which X absolutely must match what you used, Y should match but may be flexible by one or two versions, and Z is usually not that important. In a bash terminal, you can check your Python version with python --version . Let\u2019s say you built a script using Python 3.11.8 and a compatible version of Matplotlib on your own laptop. Glob patterns do not work to select subsets of ml spider or ml avail outputs, so one must view the full list with ml spider Python ( ml spider cray-python on Dardel). Here is the output on Cosmos: $ ml spider Python --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Python: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Description: Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.

In fact, nearly every other Python-based module apart from the bare Python itself requires GCC, so you may as well use GCC every time. On some facilities, each version of Matplotlib and SciPy-bundle is only be associated with one Python version, so you can load them all at once, using the GCC version to select for everything else, like this: ml GCC/13.2.0 Python matplotlib SciPy-bundle However, this is considered bad practice since sometimes additional versions are installed later. We should instead check ml avail to see what versions of Matplotlib and Scipy-bundle we can load: $ ml avail Scipy-bundle ----------------------------- /sw/easybuild_milan/modules/all/Compiler/GCC/13.2.0 ----------------------------- SciPy-bundle/2023.11 (Note: some output omitted for brevity) $ ml avail Matplotlib ----------------------------- /sw/easybuild_milan/modules/all/Compiler/GCC/13.2.0 ----------------------------- matplotlib/3.8.2 Then the one-line loading command should look like this: ml GCC/13.2.0 Python/3.11.5 matplotlib/3.8.2 SciPy-bundle/2023.11 If we check what was loaded with ml or module list , the output looks like this: $ ml Currently Loaded Modules: 1 ) SoftwareTree/Milan ( S ) 26 ) expat/2.5.0 2 ) GCCcore/13.2.0 27 ) util-linux/2.39 3 ) zlib/1.2.13 28 ) fontconfig/2.14.2 4 ) binutils/2.40 29 ) xorg-macros/1.20.0 5 ) GCC/13.2.0 30 ) libpciaccess/0.17 6 ) bzip2/1.0.8 31 ) X11/20231019 7 ) ncurses/6.4 32 ) Tk/8.6.13 8 ) libreadline/8.2 33 ) Tkinter/3.11.5 9 ) Tcl/8.6.13 34 ) NASM/2.16.01 10 ) SQLite/3.43.1 35 ) libjpeg-turbo/3.0.1 11 ) XZ/5.4.4 36 ) jbigkit/2.1 12 ) libffi/3.4.4 37 ) gzip/1.13 13 ) OpenSSL/1.1 38 ) lz4/1.9.4 14 ) Python/3.11.5 39 ) zstd/1.5.5 15 ) OpenBLAS/0.3.24 40 ) libdeflate/1.19 16 ) FlexiBLAS/3.3.1 41 ) LibTIFF/4.6.0 17 ) FFTW/3.3.10 42 ) giflib/5.2.1 18 ) cffi/1.15.1 43 ) libwebp/1.3.2 19 ) cryptography/41.0.5 44 ) OpenJPEG/2.5.0 20 ) virtualenv/20.24.6 45 ) LittleCMS/2.15 21 ) Python-bundle-PyPI/2023.10 46 ) Pillow/10.2.0 22 ) pybind11/2.11.1 47 ) Qhull/2020.2 23 ) libpng/1.6.40 48 ) matplotlib/3.8.2 24 ) Brotli/1.1.0 49 ) SciPy-bundle/2023.11 25 ) freetype/2.13.2 Where: S: Module is Sticky, requires --force to unload or purge If you are comfortable editing code in a basic text editor and running at the command-line, the modules used in the example above are all you need.

Exercise 4: Check if the python package XX is available in the present environment Extensions can be hard to find without knowing what includes them, but it is easy to check if modules that are already loaded added the extension silently. If you cannot find a package you want with ml avail , ml spider , or ml show <module> , you should also check pip list and grep for the package after loading the rest of your modules. Example: psutil For example, psutil is part of Python-bundle-PyPI, which is silently loaded with any SciPy-bundle. Here is the easiest way to find psutil : $ pip list | grep psutil psutil 5 .9.5 [ notice ] A new release of pip is available: 23 .1.2 -> 25 .1.1 [ notice ] To update, run: pip install --upgrade pip The pip list | grep approach is also helpful if you want to see the version of a package without having to open a Python interpreter. Tip The same list (and grep) approach works for Anaconda3. The only difference is that you should use conda list instead of pip list (although pip list usually still works). The Anaconda3 module file does not list the included extensions, so conda list | grep <package> is also the only way to see if a package is included without starting up a Python command line interface.

Indeed, some versions on some systems (e.g. at NSC) load and use the compilers, MPI libraries, and mathematics libraries from Intel toolchains. Now we can load everything all at once like so: $ ml GCC/11.3.0 OpenMPI/4.1.4 OpenFOAM/11 or load each one at a time. The above command loads almost 90 modules, including several Python packages and visualisation libraries, all of which can be viewed by entering ml . Exercise 3.

GCC/13.2.0 This means that, on Cosmos at least, only GCC must be loaded before Matplotlib. However, Matplotlib is barely usable without the tools to read in or create the data arrays, so NumPy and/or Pandas are also needed. At most facilities, that means SciPy-bundle is required. Note that ml show matplotlib/<version> does not show which Python version is associated with that version of Matplotlib. If GCC is loaded, then you can use ml avail with Python , matplotlib , and/or SciPy-bundle to see which versions of these are available to load. The more typical scenario is that you want to move code developed on a personal laptop to the cluster. Then you will mainly be constrained to a range of Python versions Python/X.Y.Z , in which X absolutely must match what you used, Y should match but may be flexible by one or two versions, and Z is usually not that important.

In this chapter we will look at some examples of how to find and load some of the typical software modules that are installed at many of the Swedish HPC centres. Loading modules works the same whether the modules are toolchains or standalone packages, with and without prerequisites. The procedure is usually some variation on the following: Use ml spider <package> to see whether a module is installed, and if so, view the available versions. (At facilities that do not hide packages depending on prerequisites, module avail <package> may be preferred.) Use ml spider <package>/<version> to view prerequisites for a specific version of the module, if any. Load the modules with ml <prerequisite>/<version> <package>/<version> . Most of the examples below use outputs from Cosmos, but the workflows will be similar at other institutions except where otherwise noted. Important Both R and Python packages often include many so-called extensions (dependent packages that are usually called modules when not dealing with LMOD modules) that are installed, but cannot be found with ml spider or ml avail . In these cases, if you have loaded at least the prerequisites of a standalone package containing the extension, you can use ml show <package> on the standalone package to view the Lua module file, which usually has a section on included extensions near the top. For example, NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas, among other packages, are all are included in SciPy-bundle . If you have at least loaded a GCC version, you can use ml show SciPy-bundle to view all of the included extensions (Python modules) in the compatible SciPy-bundle. Tip grep does not work directly on the outputs of module commands like ml show <module> . To search for an extension in a very long Lua module file, copy the full path of the .lua file from the ml show output, and use less /path/to/module.lua | grep <extension> . If there is no output, the extension is not present. Python-based packages \u00b6 It varies between centres how many packages are installed with the base Python packages, how many are installed as separate modules, what prerequsites are required (most centres apart from PDC are the same), and the available version numbers. Note HPC2N and C3SE: Little is installed with the Python module, but most of the common Python packages are available as extra modules (SciPy-bundle, Jupyter, mpi4py, matplotlib, tensorflow, PyTorch, Python-bundle-PyPi, \u2026) LUNARC: Little is installed with the Python module, but instead most of the common Python packages are available as extra modules (SciPy-bundle, Jupyter, mpi4py, matplotlib, tensorflow, PyTorch, Python-bundle-PyPi, \u2026). Anaconda3 bundles more into one module (SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc), but other modules loaded alongside it are typically not recognised. Additional modules must be installed in a custom environment. NSC: Little is installed with the Python module, but most of the common Python packages are available as extra modules (SciPy-bundle, matplotlib, mpi4py, PyTorch, Python-bundle-PyPi, Jupyter, \u2026). Most programs on Tetralith also have an extra prerequisite, buildtool-easybuild/4.X.X-hpc<version> that must be loaded before anything else. UPPMAX-Pelle: Little is installed with the Python module, but most of the common Python packages are available as extra modules (SciPy-bundle, matplotlib, mpi4py, Python-bundle-PyPi, Jupyter-lab, \u2026). No Prerequisites are needed! UPPMAX-Bianca: Very many packages are installed with the Python module. PDC: most modules included in SciPy-bundle (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, etc.) are in cray-python modules, and these are compatible with a couple of the installed versions of matplotlib. Python modules that do not include the cray- prefix have very little installed in them and are not compatible with most other Python-adjacent modules; these are typically intended as bases for users to build their own environments. Most programs on Dardel also have an extra prerequisite, PDC/XX.XX or PDCOLD/XX.XX that must be loaded before anything else. Example 1: Matplotlib \u00b6 Matplotlib prerequisites vary significantly across HPC centres: some require none, some need one, some need more than one, and in some cases Matplotlib is only an extension of another module ( more info on how to find Matplotlib at different HPC centres here ). If you only want to see what Matplotlib depends on, a good starting point is to view the output of ml spider matplotlib (or ml avail matplotlib on NSC), pick an arbitrary version, and view ml spider matplotlib/<version> . All of the following code blocks in this example are taken from Cosmos. $ ml spider matplotlib ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- matplotlib: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Description: matplotlib is a python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. matplotlib can be used in python scripts, the python and ipython shell, web application servers, and six graphical user interface toolkits.

Let us look at matplotlib/3.8.2 , for example: $ ml spider matplotlib/3.8.2 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- matplotlib: matplotlib/3.8.2 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Description: matplotlib is a python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. matplotlib can be used in python scripts, the python and ipython shell, web application servers, and six graphical user interface toolkits. You will need to load all module ( s ) on any one of the lines below before the \"mat plotlib/3.8.2\" module is available to load. GCC/13.2.0 This means that, on Cosmos at least, only GCC must be loaded before Matplotlib. However, Matplotlib is barely usable without the tools to read in or create the data arrays, so NumPy and/or Pandas are also needed. At most facilities, that means SciPy-bundle is required. Note that ml show matplotlib/<version> does not show which Python version is associated with that version of Matplotlib. If GCC is loaded, then you can use ml avail with Python , matplotlib , and/or SciPy-bundle to see which versions of these are available to load. The more typical scenario is that you want to move code developed on a personal laptop to the cluster. Then you will mainly be constrained to a range of Python versions Python/X.Y.Z , in which X absolutely must match what you used, Y should match but may be flexible by one or two versions, and Z is usually not that important. In a bash terminal, you can check your Python version with python --version . Let\u2019s say you built a script using Python 3.11.8 and a compatible version of Matplotlib on your own laptop. Glob patterns do not work to select subsets of ml spider or ml avail outputs, so one must view the full list with ml spider Python ( ml spider cray-python on Dardel).

Example 2: Check if a Python extension is loaded \u00b6 Extensions can be hard to find without knowing what includes them, but it is easy to check if modules that are already loaded added the extension silently. If you cannot find a package you want with ml avail , ml spider , or ml show <module> , you should also check pip list and grep for the package after loading the rest of your modules. For example, psutil is part of Python-bundle-PyPI, which is silently loaded with any SciPy-bundle.

Tip The same list (and grep) approach works for Anaconda3. The only difference is that you should use conda list instead of pip list (although pip list usually still works). The Anaconda3 module file does not list the included extensions, so conda list | grep <package> is also the only way to see if a package is included without starting up a Python command line interface. R-based packages \u00b6 At most HPC centres, the base R module usually contains relatively few extensions. Most of the popular packages are in additional bundles like R-bundle-CRAN and R-bundle-Bioconductor . Most HPC centres have prerequisites for R, but at a few, like Alvis, R can be loaded directly. Always check the prerequisites with ml spider or ml avail . Note HPC2N: Little is installed with the basic R module, but most common packages are available as extensions of R-bundle-CRAN, R-bundle-CRAN-extra, or R-bundle-Bioconductor. RStudio is a separate module and only runs on the login nodes via Thinlinc, so it should be used sparingly. LUNARC: Little is installed with the basic R module, but most common packages are available as extensions of R-bundle-CRAN or R-bundle-Bioconductor. RStudio is also a separate module, and is available as an On-Demand application that automatically loads R and various bundles at start-up. UPPMAX (Pelle): Little is installed with the basic R module, but most common packages are available as extensions of R-bundle-CRAN or R-bundle-Bioconductor. RStudio is also a separate module. UPPMAX (Bianca) and C3SE (Alvis): R can be loaded directly, but has few installed packages. More common modules are available as extensions with the R_packages module. RStudio is also a separate module. NSC (Tetralith): R can be loaded directly, but contains few installed packages, and there are no bundles to provide more. Users are typically expected to install their own extension libraries. RStudio is included in the base R module, however. PDC (Dardel): Like most programs on Dardel, R also has the prerequisite PDC/XX.XX or PDCOLD/XX.XX , but the compiler and MPI library are chosen for you. There are about 250 packages available in the basic R module, and there are no additional bundles to provide more packages. Users are typically expected to install their own extension libraries. Important Most facilities have only built a handful of R releases, so many of the dependent modules are adapted for multiple versions. The version of such any dependent package should always be specified to ensure reproducibility. If the version number is omitted, the latest will be loaded by default, and that version may change without warning.

That is not the case for all R-bundles at all HPC centres, so pay attention to the prerequisites. Matlab \u00b6 At most HPC centres, Matlab can be loaded directly, but PDC requires the usual prerequisite PDC/XX.XX or PDCOLD/XX.XX . Capitalisation and other naming conventions also vary between HPC centres; for more information, refer to this section of the R, Matlab, and Julia for HPC course .

In general, the GUI should only be run via either Desktop On Demand or after booking interactive allocations on compute nodes with salloc or interactive . For more particulars on running Matlab, see the relevant page of the R, Matlab, and Julia for HPC course materials . Example: Matlab on Tetralith (NSC) \u00b6 At most centres, where modules are hidden if prerequisites are not loaded, it is better to use ml spider to see what versions are available before accounting for preconditions. At centres where all modules are searchable without loading prerequisites, it is better to use ml avail to avoid listing modules that only exist as extensions or aliases of other modules, as in the case of Tetralith at NSC: $ ml avail matlab --------------------- /software/sse2/tetralith_el9/modules --------------------- MATLAB/recommendation ( D ) MATLAB/2024a-hpc1-bdist MATLAB/2023a-bdist MATLAB/2025a-hpc1-bdist MATLAB/2023b-bdist Where: D: Default Module Once you have chosen a specific version, use ml spider to check if there are prerequisites, like so: $ ml spider MATLAB/2024a-hpc1-bdist The full output is too verbose to reprint in full here, but the one important line reads: This module can be loaded directly: module load MATLAB/2024a-hpc1-bdist The command after the colon (:) can be copied, pasted, and entered directly into the bash prompt to load the module, or you can type the short version as follows: $ ml MATLAB/2024a-hpc1-bdist Specialised Applications \u00b6 For most specialised packages (Amber, GROMACS, Nextflow, VASP, etc), unless there is reason to believe it is included in a larger package or you include a spurious non-alphanumeric character, ml spider will tell you whether it is installed or not. If the full name of a module includes CUDA , then the relevant CUDA version will typically be loaded automatically, without the need to choose a CUDA-containing toolchain. Important Some specialised modules (e.g., Abaqus, Gaussian, and VASP) are license-restricted, so they may not load, or may load but refuse to run, if you are not part of the licensed user group. If you run ml spider on a specific version of licensed software, the description may (as with VASP) or may not (as with Gaussian) specify that a license is required. It is up to users to determine the licensing requirements of specialised software packages. Example: OpenFOAM \u00b6 As usual, we start by checking the versions available with ml spider OpenFOAM (or ml avail OpenFOAM at a facility like NSC where all modules are visible regardless of the presence of prerequisites). An example output might look like this (from Cosmos): $ ml spider OpenFOAM -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OpenFOAM: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Description: OpenFOAM is a free, open source CFD software package.

Indeed, some versions on some systems (e.g. at NSC) load and use the compilers, MPI libraries, and mathematics libraries from Intel toolchains. Now we can load everything all at once like so: $ ml GCC/11.3.0 OpenMPI/4.1.4 OpenFOAM/11 or load each one at a time.

In this chapter we will look at some examples of how to find and load some of the typical software modules that are installed at many of the Swedish HPC centres. Loading modules works the same whether the modules are toolchains or standalone packages, with and without prerequisites. The procedure is usually some variation on the following: Use ml spider <package> to see whether a module is installed, and if so, view the available versions. (At facilities that do not hide packages depending on prerequisites, module avail <package> may be preferred.) Use ml spider <package>/<version> to view prerequisites for a specific version of the module, if any. Load the modules with ml <prerequisite>/<version> <package>/<version> . Most of the examples below use outputs from Cosmos, but the workflows will be similar at other institutions except where otherwise noted. Important Both R and Python packages often include many so-called extensions (dependent packages that are usually called modules when not dealing with LMOD modules) that are installed, but cannot be found with ml spider or ml avail . In these cases, if you have loaded at least the prerequisites of a standalone package containing the extension, you can use ml show <package> on the standalone package to view the Lua module file, which usually has a section on included extensions near the top. For example, NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas, among other packages, are all are included in SciPy-bundle . If you have at least loaded a GCC version, you can use ml show SciPy-bundle to view all of the included extensions (Python modules) in the compatible SciPy-bundle. Tip grep does not work directly on the outputs of module commands like ml show <module> . To search for an extension in a very long Lua module file, copy the full path of the .lua file from the ml show output, and use less /path/to/module.lua | grep <extension> . If there is no output, the extension is not present.","title":"Examples"},{"location":"programs_old/#python-based__packages","text":"It varies between centres how many packages are installed with the base Python packages, how many are installed as separate modules, what prerequsites are required (most centres apart from PDC are the same), and the available version numbers.

GCC/13.2.0 This means that, on Cosmos at least, only GCC must be loaded before Matplotlib. However, Matplotlib is barely usable without the tools to read in or create the data arrays, so NumPy and/or Pandas are also needed. At most facilities, that means SciPy-bundle is required. Note that ml show matplotlib/<version> does not show which Python version is associated with that version of Matplotlib. If GCC is loaded, then you can use ml avail with Python , matplotlib , and/or SciPy-bundle to see which versions of these are available to load. The more typical scenario is that you want to move code developed on a personal laptop to the cluster. Then you will mainly be constrained to a range of Python versions Python/X.Y.Z , in which X absolutely must match what you used, Y should match but may be flexible by one or two versions, and Z is usually not that important.

Under this framework, software is built around \u201c toolchains \u201d: compatible groups of C and Fortran compilers, MPI libraries, linear algebra libraries, and other fundamental programs used internally by more familiar packages that users work with directly (e.g., Python, R, GROMACS, etc.). Most HPC centers recommend using toolchains to build and compile software, whether you use EasyBuild not. Toolchains: keep software consitent, everything is build using the same compiler and the same underlying libraries provides access to modern versions of the compiler, offering recent language standards and optimisation techniques. System compilers are often old - Don\u2019t use for compiling production software integrates with the module system - makes linking libraries easy Available Toolchains by HPC Center \u00b6 Toolchains for regular CPU nodes \u00b6 For most of the following toolchains, multiple versions are available on each of the specified clusters. Use ml spider <toolchain> to determine which versions are available and what modules are required as prerequisites to load them, if any. Dardel Tetralith Kebnekaise Cosmos Pelle Bianca Dardel uses the Cray Programming Environment (CPE) , which differs significantly from the setup on other NAISS and University systems. Load a cpe module to access a specific version of the CPE, e.g. ml cpe/24.11 To use installed software titles installed with the latest version of the CPE, load the PDC module ml PDC Access to older software versions is provided by loading the relevant PDCOLD module . In contrast to other systems, it is not advisable to do a module purge on Dardel when wanting to remove software. Use module unload to remove a module module swap to exchange one module for another module load which will load a module and unloads everything that conflicts On Dardel three different compilers are available. By default you get the Cray compiling environment (CCE), commonly referred to as the Cray compiler . In addition the GNU compiler suite , the Intel Programming Environment and the AMD AOCC compilers are available. The compilers can be accessed by loading on of: ml PrgEnv-cray ml PrgEnv-gnu ml PrgEng-intel ml PrgEnv-aocc The PrgEnv-cray is loaded by default after login. The modules cray-libsci , providing e.g. BLAS/LAPACK/ScaLAPACK and cray-mpich providing MPI capabilities are automatically included with all four compiler choices. For software built or intended to be built with EasyBuild, there are 3 toolchains that help to assemble the appropriate combinations of the modules mentioned above, among other tools to support parallel programming. cpeCRAY: based on PrgEnv-cray cpeAMD: based on PrgEnv-gnu cpeGNU: based on PrgEnv-aocc In the interest of time, we refer readers to this page on the CPE and this page on CPE-based toolchains . The toolchains available on Tetralith are called buildenv , which stands for build environment. For CPU code build environments based on the Intel compiler and the GNU compiler suite are provided. Check module avail buildenv-gcc or module avail buildenv-intel To check the available versions. For example command module help buildenv-gcc/2023b-eb shows what is included in the module. In case of buildenv-gcc/2023b-eb it is OpenMPI for MPI support, OpenBLAS (BLAS and LAPACK support), FFTW and ScaLAPACK in addtion to the GCC compiler suite. The buildenv-intel/2023a-eb contains Intel C/C++ and Fortran compilers, Intel MPI and Intel MKL.

The version numbers indicate roughly when each version was released. Version 2023a was released at the beginning of 2023, 2023b in the middle of 2023, and 2024a at the start of 2024. If you load e.g. the foss/2024a module as shown below, module load foss/2024a It will load several modules for you, including the compiler, libraries, and other utilities.

Use ml avail to see what modules you can load given the toolchain you\u2019ve loaded. For some packages with very long or very short release intervals, there may be multiple versions of a software package available for your chosen toolchain. The version that loads by default if no version number is given will have a (D) to the right of it when listed using ml avail . This default version is subject to change, so it is recommended to always provide version numbers. Not all modules have a version associated with your choice of toolchain. If you switch toolchains, keep the following in mind: The module system will attempt to upgrade or downgrade any previously loaded modules to match the new choice of toolchain. If one or more modules loaded with the previous choice of toolchain do not have a version installed that is compatible with the new toolchain, then the module system will raise an error. For some packages (e.g., Python, Perl, etc.) there is a system version built into the operating system that runs without loading any module or toolchain. These should be avoided since they are subject to change.
