## Important info

- There is an "important info" page for this course, containing info on the course project, login info for Tetralith/Dardel????, etc. 
    - It can be found here: 
- There is a Q/A page for use during the lectures. Since the lectures are recorded, you may get recorded if you ask questions in the Zoom, but you can always write questions on the Q/A and get answers there. It also has the advantage that you can go back and look at the answers later.
