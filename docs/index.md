# Welcome to the course: Selecting software modules 

This NAISS course is given under under NAISS, by staff working at the branches located at UPPMAX, LUNARC, HPC2N, and Chalmers, and will cover clusters at those facilities as well as at NSC (Tetralith) and PDC (Dardel).

    - Basic Linux 

    If you lack Linux experience, please follow a tutorial before the course. 

    This is from a recent NAISS course about basic Linux:

!!! note "Learning outcome"   

     - What is the module system?
     - Why do I want to use the module system? 
     - What happens when I load/unload modules? 
         - paths
         - environment variables
         - more?
     - some talk about EasyBuild?
     - Useful commands
     - Load examples
     - Compiler toolchains 

!!! admonition "Cluster-specific approaches"

    The course will show you how to find and load modules. While the modules may be somewhat differently named and have somewhat different versions depending on the system, the procedure and commands are the same. 

    We will use Tetralith or Dardel for those who do not have other access to a Swedish HPC system, and some examples will be shown for other centres. You should be able to code-along - with minor adjustments - regardless of which center you are at. 

## Important info

- There is an "important info" page for this course, containing info on the course project, login info for Tetralith, etc. 
    - It can be found here: <a href="https://umeauniversity.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/HPC2N630/IQCIuKfFeZ0LQaYcbBxLDbJuAXjnS1L2alDFAuVZeZ5x5q4" target="_blank">https://umeauniversity.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/HPC2N630/IQCIuKfFeZ0LQaYcbBxLDbJuAXjnS1L2alDFAuVZeZ5x5q4</a> 
- There is a Q/A page for use during the lectures. Since the lectures are recorded, you may get recorded if you ask questions in the Zoom, but you can always write questions on the Q/A and get answers there. It also has the advantage that you can go back and look at the answers later. 
    - The Q/A page can be found here: <a href="https://umeauniversity.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/HPC2N630/IQDq6IoVBUkRSb20kEV-jyY3AfzZn0crN5hUQisNRDA6H8I" target="_blank">https://umeauniversity.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/HPC2N630/IQDq6IoVBUkRSb20kEV-jyY3AfzZn0crN5hUQisNRDA6H8I</a>

## Preparations 

In order to type along and do the exercises, please prepare your course environment now:

!!! note "1. Login"

    Login to the system you are using (Tetralith/Dardel, other Swedish HPC system)

    - You will not need a graphical user interface for this course.

If this is not possible, contact ``support@chalmers.se`` and ask to be added to the Chalmers's eduVPN. 

!!! note "2. Setup a working directory"

    You will not need a lot of space for the exercises, so you can create the directory under your home directory. 

    - Create a directory to work in (``mkdir $HOME/selecting-modules``) 
    - and then switch to it (``cd $HOME/selecting-modules``)

!!! note "3. Download the exercises" 

    - ``wget https://github.com/hpc2n/selecting-modules/raw/refs/heads/main/exercises.tar.gz``

    ??? question "Bianca user"

        - Stay in the created folder (``cd $HOME/selecting-modules``)
        - Copy the tar ball from the project's folder to your created folder: 
        
            - ``cp /proj/sens2025560/selecting_modules/exercises.tar.gz . ``

        - Let the teacher know if it is missing.

!!! note "4. Extract the exercises" 

    - ``tar zxvf exercises.tar.gz``

!!! note "5. Enter the directory that was created"

    - ``cd exercises``
