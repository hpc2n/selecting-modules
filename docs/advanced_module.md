# Advanced module commands 

This section contains some more advanced module commands which will not be coverered by this course. 

## Module collections

If there is often a specific list of modules that you need, you can save them in a "collection" which you can then "restore" when you need it. 

- ``module save <collection>``: saves the currently loaded modules to a collection named <collection>. The collection will be created if it does not already exist.
- ``module restore <collection>``: restores (loads) the modules in the collection named <collection>.
