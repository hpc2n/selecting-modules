# Examples

Loading modules works the same, whether it is toolchains or other software modules (with and without prerequisites). 

In the previous section we looked at toolchains, which are often used to install your own software and to build your own software. 

In this chapter we will look at some examples of how to find and load some of the typical software modules that are installed at many of the Swedish HPC centres. 


## Python-based packages

It varies between centres how many packages are installed with the base Python packages and how many are installed as separate modules. 

!!! note 

    - HPC2N: Little is installed with the Python module, but instead most of the common Python packages are available as extra modules (SciPy-bundle, mpi4py, matplotlib, tensorflow, ...)
    - UPPMAX: The base Python module contains most Python packages. A few ML specific packages are available in ML_python_packages(_cpu, _gpu) 
    - LUNARC: Little is installed with the Python module, but instead most of the common Python packages are available as extra modules (SciPy-bundle, mpi4py, matplotlib, tensorflow, ...)
    - C3SE: 
    - NSC: 
    - PDC:

Example: 

## R-based packages

Example: Bioconductor(?)

## Matlab

At most HPC centers, Matlab can be loaded directly.

Example:

## Specialized Applications
